# Abhishek Kumar

I'm currently pursuing MCA @ NITK, Surathkal. I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, machine learning, and Data Science. I enjoy building clean, maintainable, and efficient software using Java, C/C++, Python, and modern web technologies. I'm always eager to learn new things and work on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.

In addition to my academic work, I have developed strong practical skills across web development and data science:

### Web Development
- Experienced in building interactive front-end interfaces with `React`
- Skilled in developing backend services using `Node.js` and `Express`
- Comfortable working with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` for clean and responsive UI development
- Familiar with modern toolchains like `Vite` and UI frameworks like `Bootstrap` to streamline development

### Data Science & Machine Learning
- Skilled in data handling and analysis using `NumPy` and `Pandas`
- Capable of building ML models and preprocessing pipelines using `Scikit-learn`
- Experienced in visualization and exploratory analysis with `Matplotlib`
- Efficient in experimentation and workflow documentation using `Jupyter Notebook`

### Development Approach
- Focused on writing clear, organized, and maintainable code
- Strong interest in designing structured workflows, from data preparation to model evaluation
- Consistent in applying good coding practices and iterative improvement
